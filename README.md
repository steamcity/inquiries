# SteamCity Inquiries Repository

This repository collects all the educational inquiries and experimentation protocols developed in the framework of the [SteamCity Project](https://www.steamcity.eu/).

SteamCity promotes the integration of scientific inquiry at school through interdisciplinary and project-based learning. It links STEAM education with humanities to address the challenges of smart and sustainable cities.

## Purpose

This repository provides structured access to classroom-oriented resources. These resources aim to foster students' ability to analyse, design, experiment, and make informed decisions to positively impact their urban environment.

## Structure of the Repository

You can explore the 25 inquiries and their experimentation protocols in different ways, depending on your needs.

### Access to all resources at once

A dedicated folder provides direct access to all inquiries and protocols in a single place.
