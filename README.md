This repository collects all the educational inquiries and experimentation protocols developed in the framework of the [SteamCity Project](https://www.steamcity.eu/).

SteamCity promotes the integration of scientific inquiry at school through interdisciplinary and project-based learning. It links STEAM education with humanities to address the challenges of smart and sustainable cities.
